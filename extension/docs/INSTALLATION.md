# Chrome Extension Installation & Testing Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Extension

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension/` folder from this project
5. The Virtual Try-On extension should now appear in your extensions list

### 2. Verify Installation

- Look for the extension icon (ðŸ‘•) in your Chrome toolbar
- Click the icon to open the popup and check service status
- The status dots should show red (offline) until MCP services are running

### 3. Start MCP Services

Make sure both MCP services are running:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start MCP-A (Try-On Service)
cd mcp_vton/
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8001

# Terminal 2: Start MCP-B (Video Service)
cd mcp_video/
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8002
```

### 4. Test with Demo Page

1. Open `extension/assets/demo_product_page.html` in Chrome
2. You should see a "ðŸ‘• Try it on" button appear on the page
3. Click the button to test the full try-on flow
4. Use the demo selfie option for quick testing

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
```bash
# Check for JavaScript errors in Chrome DevTools
# Go to chrome://extensions/ and click "Errors" if any appear
```

### Try-On Button Not Appearing
1. Refresh the page after installing extension
2. Check popup to verify page detection
3. Look for console errors in DevTools
4. Ensure you're on a product page (not category/search page)

### API Calls Failing
1. Verify MCP services are running on correct ports
2. Check service status in extension popup
3. Look for CORS errors in Network tab
4. Ensure localhost:8001 and localhost:8002 are accessible

### Content Script Issues
```javascript
// Debug in browser console
console.log('VTON Extension loaded:', !!window.VTONExtension);
```

## Development Tips

### Debugging Content Script
1. Open DevTools on any page
2. Go to Console tab
3. Check for extension-related logs
4. Use `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to test background communication

### Debugging Background Script
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click "service worker" link under your extension
3. This opens DevTools for the background script
4. Check console for API call logs

### Debugging Popup
1. Right-click the extension icon
2. Select "Inspect popup"
3. This opens DevTools for the popup
4. Debug popup JavaScript and styling

### Reloading Changes
- Click the refresh icon on your extension in `chrome://extensions/`
- Or use Ctrl+R in the extension popup/background DevTools
- Content scripts require page refresh to update
